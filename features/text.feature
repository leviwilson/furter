Feature:  Working with text controls

  Scenario: Getting and setting text by placeholder
    When I set the text identified by "placeholder" to "The first field's text"
    Then the text on the "DetailPage" identified by "placeholder" should be "The first field's text"

  Scenario: Getting and setting text by label
    When I set the text identified by "label" to "the label text"
    Then the text on the "DetailPage" identified by "label" should be "the label text"

  Scenario: Determining if a text field is editable
    Then we know if a text field is both editable and not editable

  Scenario: Working with the raw view
    Then we can interact with the raw text view identified by "placeholder"
